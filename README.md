## Python Projects ## 

#### Project 1: Comprehensive Retail Analysis
- **Description:** Analyzed a dataset of sales transactions to identify trends, seasonality, and key performance metrics.
  
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy)
- **Link:** [Retail Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/marcoserrano21/comprehensive-retail-analysis)

#### Project 2: Personal Finance Tracker
- **Description:**
  
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, CSV)
- **Link:** [Personal Finance Tracker](link-to-project)

#### Project 3: Vehicle Dataset Cleaning Project
- **Description:** In this notebook, I clean and preprocess a vehicle dataset using Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for visualizations. I handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure the data is normalized and ready for further analysis or modeling.

- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy)
- **Link:** [Vehicle Dataset Cleaning](https://github.com/marcoserrano21/vehicle_dataset_cleaning_project/tree/main)

#### Project 4: CS50P: Random Pastel Generator - Final Project
- **Description:** This project is a Python-based Pastel Color Generator that allows users to generate and display random pastel colors graphically using Matplotlib. The application generates a random color in hex format, converts it to an RGB format, and displays it on the screen. It then asks the user if they want to generate another color.
  
- **Tools:** Python (Matplotlib, random) 
- **Link:** [Random Pastel Generator](https://github.com/marcoserrano21/random_pastel)

<!-- ## SQL Projects
